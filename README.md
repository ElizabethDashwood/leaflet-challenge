## Module 15 Homework leaflet-challenge
### Description:
This is the Module 15 Homework leaflet-challenge for using leaflet with html, css and javascript.  Data for all earthquakes in the past 7 days was sourced from GeoJSON at https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson.  OpenStreetMap at https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright is also used for provision of Base maps for street and topography views.  

### Getting started:
This challenge has 1 project called: Leaflet-Part-1 for the leaflet-challenge. It contains starter code for the index.hmtl file which enables to display of the maps as per the javascript code written in the blank logic.js starter code file. 

### Installations required:
These projects have been run in a Windows 11 GitBash environment, using Python 3.10.13 together with Visual Studio Code.

### Executing Homework Challenge Requirements:
Please see the index.html file and logic.js file for all code relating to this project. 
Note:  I attempted using:

* (1) the street and topography style of map, while basing my code on the Week 15 Day 1 exercises 09-Stu_City_Population_Layers and 10-Stu_GeoJson
* (2) the start of a choropleth map, thinking that this better reflected the style of map shown in the challenge requirements, as was shown in Week 15 Day 2 exercise 04-Par_SchoolDistrictChoropleth.  I have since moved these choropleth versions to the Obsolete files folder. 

However, I was not able to complete the maps in full, so I concentrated on the initial street and topography map.
